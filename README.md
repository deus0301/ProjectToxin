## 🎮 Overview

**Project TOXIN** is a third-person psychological thriller RPG set in a dystopian future where humanity has fled underground after toxic nanites consumed the surface. You play as a human-nanite hybrid created to reclaim the overworld—but cursed to emit deadly toxins that kill any human you approach.

### Core Concept

- **You cannot interact with the living** - Only communicate with ghosts
- **Every choice matters** - Build morality by completing ghost quests or lose it by creating new spirits
- **Hybrid existence** - Balance your humanity against your nanite nature
- **Environmental storytelling** - Uncover the truth through corrupted beacons and ghost memories

## 🎯 Key Features

### Ghost-Bound Interaction System
- Communicate exclusively with spirits who have unfinished business
- Complete quests to gain morality and unlock abilities
- Each ghost offers unique combat techniques and traversal powers

### Dynamic Morality System
- **High Morality Path**: Help ghosts find peace, send humans back underground safely
- **Low Morality Path**: Kill humans to create new ghosts, embrace your toxic nature
- Your choices determine the planet's future

### Nanite Absorption & Beacons
- **Passive Absorption**: Constantly collect stray nanites from the environment
- **Core Capacity Management**: Strategic resource management with maximum limits
- **Beacon Network**:

### World Design
